# IBM Article Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project develops a recommendation system for IBM Watson Studio articles. Using real user interaction data, the system suggests relevant articles to users through multiple recommendation techniques.

## Recommendation Approaches Implemented
1. **Rank-Based Recommendations**: Suggests popular articles to new users
2. **User-User Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends articles based on similar user preferences
3. **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzes article content to find similar articles
4. **Matrix Factorization**: Uncovers latent features connecting users and articles

## Key Features
- Analysis of user interaction patterns with articles
- Implementation of multiple recommendation strategies
- Evaluation of recommendation quality using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics
- Handling of cold-start problems for new users and articles

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Scikit-learn for machine learning components
- Natural Language Processing for content analysis

## Project Structure
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Implementation of recommendation algorithms
- Performance evaluation and comparison
- Discussion of use cases for each approach

## Results
The system successfully identifies relevant articles for users based on their reading history and preferences. Different recommendation approaches are suitable for different scenarios, and can be combined for optimal results.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate article content beyond titles
- Develop hybrid recommendation approaches
- Implement real-time recommendation updates
